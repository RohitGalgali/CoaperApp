# What is CoAP?
A constrained application protocol is a communication media which is used by remote low latency devices to transmit data over the network. This protocol is majorly used in IoT devices which are located in remote geographical locations where internet connectivity is poor and power usage is minimal. This lightweight protocol is very helpful for applications using sensors since they transmit small packets of data and do not require a strong internet. 

# Why Coaper?
This application helps to find Coap based IoT devices which are present in the network and can command these devices over a very low bandwidth. Now you don't have to keep track of older Mozilla firefox to support Copper extension which was used to find the IoT devices. Just install this application and enter your IoT device IP Address in the address bar and hit Discover to get all the resources. Test your IoT devices and control them over this application. 

(This application is under development. Do contribute to it and I will be more than happy to accommodate your valuable changes to the code base)
